Javascript Objects:
	*	Javascript object is one of the datatypes where the data is stored in a variable in a format of key:value pairs
	*	Main Advantage is that, instead of assigning more variables to store different content related to any kind(e.g contact details), here in single object more keys:value pairs can be set.
	(e.g) Name:Rakesh, Age:31, fav_food:["biriyani", "dosa"]
	*	For object variables, Key:value pairs are mentioned in curly braces {}. Key name should not duplicate, but value assigned can be of any value and any datatypes like string, numbers, float, boolean, list, subobject.
	Syntax:
		const ObjectVariableName = {
			Key1	:	string,
			Key2	:	number,
			Key3	:	float,
			Key4	:	boolean,
			Key5	:	[]
		}
	
	e.g :
		const ObjectVariableName = {
			Name	:	"Bright",
			Age		:	30,
			Married	:	true,
			fav_food:	["biriyani", "dosa"]
		}
